              Founded to accelerate the nation’s industrial revolution, MIT is
              profoundly American. With ingenuity and drive, our graduates have
              invented fundamental technologies, launched new industries, and
              created millions of American jobs. At the same time, and without
              the slightest sense of contradiction, MIT is profoundly global.

            <p class="about__text">
              Our community gains tremendous strength as a magnet for talent
              from around the world. Through teaching, research, and innovation,
              MIT’s exceptional community pursues its mission of service to the
              nation and the world.

              <span>The mission of MIT</span> is to advance knowledge and
              educate students in science, technology, and other areas of
              scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the
              21st century. The Institute is committed to generating,
              disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with
              others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great
              challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an
              education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement
              of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a
              diverse campus community. We seek to develop in each member of the
              MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively,
              and effectively for the betterment of humankind.

                We strive for the highest standards of integrity, and
                intellectual and creative excellence. We seek new knowledge and
                practical impact, in service to the nation and the world. We
                prize originality, ingenuity, honesty, and boldness. We love
                discovery and exploration, invention and making. We delight in
                the full spectrum of human wisdom. Drawing strength from MIT’s
                distinctive roots, we believe in learning by doing, and we blur
                the boundaries between disciplines as we seek to solve hard
                problems. Embracing the unconventional, we welcome quirkiness,
                nerdiness, creative irreverence, and play. We accept the risk of
                failing as a rung on the ladder of growth. With fearless
                curiosity, we question our assumptions, look outward, and learn
                from others.

                We champion the open sharing of information and ideas. Because

                commit to using these tools with respect for each other and our
                community. We strive to be transparent and worthy of each
                other’s trust – and we challenge ourselves to face difficult
                facts, speak plainly about failings in our systems, and work to
                overcome them. We take special care not to overlook bad behavior
                or disrespect on the grounds of great accomplishment, talent, or
                power.

                where people from a diverse range of backgrounds can grow and
                thrive – and where we all feel that we belong. We know that
                attending to our own and each other’s wellbeing in mind, body,
                and spirit is essential. We believe that decency, kindness,
                respect, and compassion for each other as human beings are signs
                of strength. Valuing potential over pedigree, we know that
                talent and good ideas can come from anywhere – and we value one
                another’s contributions in every role. Together we possess
                uncommon strengths, and we shoulder the responsibility to use
                them with wisdom and care for humanity and the natural world.

            MIT’s collaborative, hands-on, curiosity-driven ethos extends across
            our campus — and beyond. On the stage or field, in makerspaces and
            living communities, MIT is where brilliant, committed, creative
            people come together to learn, work, live, and play. All the
            elements are here to cultivate students’ personal and intellectual
            growth, fostering the whole student.

              With 500+ student organizations (chocolate science, anyone?),
              nearly 40 Greek-letter and independent living groups, chaplains
              for more than 20 faith traditions, and a commitment to diversity
              and inclusion, student life at MIT offers a welcoming place for
              everyone. To complement their academics and research, students
              choose their own extracurricular adventures, from a spectacular
              array of ways to participate in music, dance, and sports to dozens
              of groups that savor and celebrate cultures from around the world.
              To help students navigate challenges, MIT offers a strong support
              network (bolstered by occasional visits from puppies, pigs, and
              pygmy goats).
